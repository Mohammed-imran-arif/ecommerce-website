# My Project Ecommerce
Welcome to my Ecommerce project. This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a web developer.
- Developed a comprehensive e-commerce application featuring login, home, products, cart, and logout functionalities. Implemented JWT for user authentication and authorization. Added category sections and price sorting options (high-to-low and low-to-high).
- Utilized a tech stack including ReactJS (with class components and state management), React Router for navigation, React Context for state management, and JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
- Authenticated Credentials: Prime:Username:rahul, Password:rahul@2021 and non Prime: username:mosh, password:DevMosh22
